## 🌌 **About TinyAGI Hub**

TinyAGI Hub is a **centralized marketplace** for community-contributed components that enhance the TinyAGI framework. By enabling users to share their own agents, plugins, modules, and tools, TinyAGI Hub accelerates AGI development and provides users with a rich repository of resources to create more powerful and adaptable AGI systems.

Contributions are organized into categories to make it easy for users to find the exact functionality they need, from specialized agents to API-integrated tools. Join the TinyAGI community in building a truly collaborative platform for AGI innovation!

## 📂 **Categories**

TinyAGI Hub organizes contributions into four primary categories. Each category is designed to support a unique aspect of TinyAGI’s functionality, making it easier for users to integrate and experiment with a diverse range of components.

### 🔹 **Agents**

The [Agents](https://github.com/SullyGreene/TinyAGI-Hub/Agents) category houses specialized AI agents with custom configurations and behaviors. These agents can be configured for tasks such as language generation, data analysis, interactive chat, and more. By downloading and configuring different agents, you can quickly create unique behaviors in your TinyAGI setup.

### 🔹 **Plugins**

Plugins in the [Plugins](https://github.com/SullyGreene/TinyAGI-Hub/Plugins) category extend the core functionality of TinyAGI by adding new capabilities. Examples include plugins for text summarization, content formatting, reference generation, and more. With plugins, TinyAGI becomes a flexible platform that adapts to your specific needs.

### 🔹 **Modules**

The [Modules](https://github.com/SullyGreene/TinyAGI-Hub/Modules) category includes reusable components that enhance the core architecture of TinyAGI. Modules may contain utilities, helper functions, or extensions that streamline development, data processing, and communication across agents.

### 🔹 **Tools**

The [Tools](https://github.com/SullyGreene/TinyAGI-Hub/Tools) category offers integrations with external resources such as APIs, data sources, and other libraries. Examples include Wikipedia lookup tools, data visualization tools, and API connectors that help agents access and process external information.
